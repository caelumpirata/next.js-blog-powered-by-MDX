Follow these steps to remove the unwanted apps from you Android Device easily.

## Things you will need
1. Computer
2. Usb Cable
3. <Link href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools">SDK Platform Tools</Link>

## 1. Connect your Android Device with ADB
Open Settings in your Android Device.
Navigate to About Phone.
Tap Build Number 7-8 times.
> Doing this will enable Developers option.

Go to Developers Options.
Inside `DEBUGGING` section, Enable Android Debugging.

Now,
Extract the `.zip` file you downloaded and navigate to `platform-tools` and open `cmd` in that directory.

    <Image
      src="/cmd.webp"
      alt="how to open cmd in current directory"
      width={1280}
      height={720}
      priority={true}
    />

run the following command
```
adb devices
```

Accept the Allow USB Debugging popup in you android device.

Next,
```
adb shell
```

this command will list the packages installed inside your device
```
pm list packages
```

2. Uninstalling the Apps
To uninstall the apps, we  will need the exact package name of the app.
`App info` shows the package name
    <Image
      src="/app_info.webp"
      alt="find package name in app info"
      width={1280}
      height={720}
      priority={true}
    />
or, 
you can download this to get the package name

<Link href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubqsoft.sec01&hl=en_US">App Inspector - Apps on Google Play</Link>

run this command to delete the app
```
pm uninstall -k --user 0 NameOfPackage
```

in my case it is  `org.lineage0s.audiofx`
    <Image
      src="/uninstall.webp"
      alt="uninstalled package"
      width={1280}
      height={720}
      priority={true}
    />
