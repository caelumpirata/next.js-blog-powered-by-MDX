🚀 Secure your Docker app with HTTPS! Obtain an SSL certificate using Certbot, and set up Nginx as a reverse proxy for added protection. 🛡️🔒  🐳

## Prerequisites:
✅ Ensure your domain points to the external IP address of this instance.

## Step 1: Get a 📜 SSL/TLS Certificate
You need a certificate to enable 🔒 HTTPS for your Docker application. You can either get one from a trusted CA like 🌐 Let's Encrypt or generate a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.

## Step 2: Install Certbot (optional)
If you choose Let's Encrypt, you can install Certbot to make certificate issuance and renewal easier.

## Step 3: Obtain the Certificate
Run the Certbot command to obtain the 📜 SSL certificate for your domain (replace "your_domain.com" with your actual domain):
```
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
```
## Step 4: Configure Docker and Web Server
You can either set up your Docker application directly to use the certificate or use a reverse proxy like 🚀 Nginx to handle HTTPS connections and forward them to your app.

### 1. Directly Use the Certificate in Docker
If your Docker app supports SSL/TLS directly, copy the 📜 SSL certificate and private key files to the appropriate location within your Docker container. Then configure your app to use them.

### 2. Set Up Nginx Reverse Proxy
Install Nginx:
```
sudo apt install nginx
```
Create an Nginx configuration file for your app in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ (e.g., your_app.conf) with the following content (replace "your_domain.com" and the proxy_pass URL):
```
server {
   listen 80;
   server_name your_domain.com;

   location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
       root /var/www/html;
   }

   location / {
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
   }
}

server {
   listen 443 ssl;
   server_name your_domain.com;

   ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/fullchain.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/privkey.pem;

   location / {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   }
}
```
Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_app.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
Test the Nginx configuration:
```
sudo nginx -t
```
If successful, restart Nginx:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
## Step 5: Firewall Configuration
Ensure that your firewall allows incoming HTTPS traffic on port 443:
```
sudo ufw allow 443
```
## Step 6: Renewing the Certificate (if using Let's Encrypt)
Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. To automatically renew the certificate, set up a cron job:
```
sudo crontab -e
```
Add the following line to run the renewal process every week:
```
0 0 * * 0 /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
```
## 🚀 Adding Second Application to Nginx with HTTPS | Certbot & Reverse Proxy 📜
1. Stop Nginx: `sudo systemctl stop nginx`
2. Obtain SSL certificate: `sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d app2.example.com`
3. Start Nginx: `sudo systemctl start nginx`
4. Update Nginx config (`app_name.conf`):

## 🚀 Here's how the final code will look
```
server {
   listen 80;
   server_name your_domain.com app2your_domain.com;

   location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
       root /var/www/html;
   }

   location / {
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
   }
}

server {
   listen 443 ssl;
   server_name your_domain.com;

   ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/fullchain.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/privkey.pem;

   location / {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   }
}

server {
   listen 443 ssl;
   server_name app2.your_domain.com;

   ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/app2.your_domain.com/fullchain.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app2.your_domain.com/privkey.pem;

   location / {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:1880;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   }
}
```
That's it! Your Docker application should now be accessible over HTTPS. Remember to replace "your_domain.com" and adapt the configurations to your specific setup. Happy secure browsing! 🚀🔒
